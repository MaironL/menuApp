## Overview

The objective of the app is to be able to make a request to an API, to collect dishes, and to be able to add and delete those dishes from a menu, 2 of these dishes must be vegan, and 2 must be non-vegan, also be able to see the details of the menu, and the details of the dishes. I went a little further and added the option to be able to create multiple menus, delete them, and edit them if desired.

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- use Boostrap
- Create a login
- validation without libraries
- only use Hooks (no redux)
- get average price, healscore, and time of menu
- filter dishes by types (vegan/non-vegan)
- crud sistem for dishes
- Form to make API request, validate with use Formik
- Use of React router Dom
- use of localStorage
