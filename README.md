## Overview

The objective of the app is to be able to make a request to an API, to collect dishes, and to be able to add and delete those dishes from a menu, 2 of these dishes must be vegan, and 2 must be non-vegan, also be able to see the details of the menu, and the details of the dishes. I went a little further and added the option to be able to create multiple menus, delete them, and edit them if desired.

I create a Node Express API Rest with MongoDB to create a login/register authentication with JWT

### The challenge
